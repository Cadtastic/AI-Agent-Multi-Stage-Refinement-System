# AI Model Selection & Deployment Guide

## **1. Overview**
This guide provides best practices for selecting, configuring, and deploying AI models within the **Iterative Refinement Engine**. It ensures optimal model performance while balancing cost, efficiency, and response accuracy.

## **2. Objectives**
- Select the most suitable **LLM model** based on workload requirements.
- Optimize **model configurations** for response speed and accuracy.
- Implement **deployment strategies** to support scalability and cost-effectiveness.
- Monitor **model performance** and retrain when necessary.

## **3. AI Model Selection Criteria**

### **3.1 Model Capabilities & Suitability**
- Compare available **LLM models** (e.g., GPT-4 for high-accuracy tasks, GPT-3.5 for cost-effective general use, Codex for code generation) for different use cases.
- Evaluate models based on **token efficiency, response quality, and latency**.
- Consider **fine-tuned models** for domain-specific optimizations.

### **3.2 Cost & Resource Considerations**
- Balance **compute cost vs. accuracy** for different task requirements.
- Optimize **token consumption** to reduce API usage costs.
- Use **serverless model deployments** where feasible to minimize infrastructure expenses, such as for infrequent queries or burst workloads where on-demand scaling is beneficial.

## **4. Model Deployment Strategies**

### **4.1 Cloud-Based Deployment**
- Deploy models using **Azure OpenAI Service** for managed scalability, leveraging automatic load balancing and resource allocation to handle varying workloads efficiently.
- Utilize **containerized deployments** via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for flexibility.
- Implement **auto-scaling** to adjust model resources dynamically, scaling up based on increased API request volume and scaling down during low-usage periods to optimize cost efficiency.

### **4.2 On-Premise & Hybrid Deployment**
- Use **on-premise deployments** for low-latency or data-sensitive environments.
- Implement **hybrid cloud models** to leverage both cloud and on-premise infrastructure.
- Ensure **secure model hosting** with strict access control policies.

## **5. Model Performance Optimization**

### **5.1 Configuration & Fine-Tuning**
- Adjust **temperature, max tokens, and top-k settings** for optimal response control.
- Fine-tune models using **domain-specific datasets** (e.g., legal text corpora for legal AI models, medical literature for healthcare AI) for improved accuracy.
- Implement **quantization** to reduce model size and improve inference speed, balancing reduced precision with minor accuracy trade-offs.

### **5.2 Continuous Monitoring & Retraining**
- Use **Azure Monitor** to track model performance and detect drift, monitoring key metrics such as response latency, accuracy shifts, and token utilization patterns.
- Implement **automated retraining pipelines** based on user feedback and accuracy metrics, running on a scheduled basis with adaptive retraining intervals depending on detected model drift.
- Optimize inference speed using **low-latency model serving techniques**, such as model pruning, optimized tensor operations, and GPU acceleration.
