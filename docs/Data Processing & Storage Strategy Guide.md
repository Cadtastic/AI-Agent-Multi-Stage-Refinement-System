# Data Processing & Storage Strategy Guide

## **1. Overview**
This guide provides best practices for **data processing, storage management, and retention policies** within the **Iterative Refinement Engine**. Proper data handling ensures efficiency, security, and compliance with industry standards.

## **2. Objectives**
- Define **data ingestion and preprocessing workflows** for AI model inputs.
- Implement **efficient storage strategies** for structured and unstructured data.
- Ensure **compliance with data retention and deletion policies**.
- Optimize **data access and retrieval for high-performance AI systems**.

## **3. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

### **3.1 Data Sources & Collection**
- Support **structured (databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, APIs following REST or GraphQL standards) and unstructured (text, images) data**.
- Implement **real-time and batch data ingestion pipelines**.
- Validate incoming data using **schema enforcement (e.g., JSON Schema, Avro) and anomaly detection techniques such as statistical outlier detection and machine learning-based pattern recognition**.

### **3.2 Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Remove **duplicates, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data** before processing.
- Normalize and standardize data to ensure consistency.
- Apply **tokenization, embedding generation, and vectorization** for AI model readiness.

## **4. Data Storage & Management**

### **4.1 Storage Architecture**
- Use **Azure Blob Storage** for unstructured data and **Azure SQL for transactional workloads** while **Cosmos DB is recommended for globally distributed, low-latency applications**.
- Implement **data partitioning** for efficient query performance.
- Optimize **cold, warm, and hot storage tiers** for cost-effectiveness.

### **4.2 Data Access & Indexing**
- Enable **indexed searching and query optimization** for faster lookups.
- Use **caching (Redis, in-memory storage)** to reduce repeated queries.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to secure sensitive data.

## **5. Data Retention & Compliance**

### **5.1 Retention Policies**
- Define **short-term and long-term retention periods** based on regulatory needs.
- Implement **automated data expiration** for compliance with privacy laws.
- Ensure **secure deletion** methods to remove sensitive data permanently, utilizing cryptographic erasure, data shredding, or DoD 5220.22-M-compliant overwriting techniques.

### **5.2 Compliance & Security**
- Adhere to **GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and SOC 2** compliance standards.
- Use **encryption (AES-256) and TLS 1.3** for data security.
- Conduct **regular audits (quarterly or biannually) and maintain access logs with audit trails for compliance monitoring**.

## **6. Performance Optimization & Monitoring**

### **6.1 Data Processing Efficiency**
- Implement **parallel processing** for large-scale data operations.
- Use **batch processing for large-scale, periodic data updates** and **stream processing for real-time, event-driven workloads** based on workload type.
- Optimize **ETL pipelines** to reduce data ingestion latency by implementing parallel processing, incremental data loading, and optimized query execution.

### **6.2 Monitoring & Alerts**
- Track **storage utilization, query performance, and data access patterns**, prioritizing key metrics such as query execution time, disk I/O, and access frequency.
- Set up **automated alerts** for unexpected spikes in data activity, defining thresholds for anomalies such as sudden increases in query volume or storage utilization.
- Use **machine learning-based anomaly detection** to identify irregular data trends.
