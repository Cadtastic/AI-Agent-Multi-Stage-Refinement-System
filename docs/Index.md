# AI-Agent-Multi-Stage-Refinement-System
This system enhances AI responses through iterative refinement, using latent recurrent processing and multi-agent task execution to optimize quality and token usage. Specialized agents (Clarification, Research, Summarization) collaborate dynamically, integrating user feedback to refine outputs in real time.
