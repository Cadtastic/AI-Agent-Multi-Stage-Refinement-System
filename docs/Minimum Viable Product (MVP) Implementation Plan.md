# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Implementation Plan

## **1. Overview**
This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the **Iterative Refinement Engine**, starting with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to establish core functionalities before expanding to full capabilities. The MVP ensures a functional, scalable foundation while allowing incremental improvements based on user feedback and system performance.

## **2. Objectives**
- Deploy a **baseline system** with essential features.
- Establish a **scalable architecture** that allows for future enhancements.
- Prioritize **core AI processing and response generation**.
- Implement **basic monitoring, security, and governance**.

## **3. MVP Scope & Features**

### **3.1 Core Components**
- **User Input Processing**: API for handling and validating user requests.
- **LLM Integration**: Basic model interface for generating responses.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Manages request flow and assigns tasks to agents.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Tracks system performance and failures.

### **3.2 Initial AI Capabilities**
- **Response Generation**: LLM-based answer generation.
- **Basic Refinement Loop**: Iterative adjustments for response accuracy.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assessing output reliability.

### **3.3 Security & Compliance**
- **Basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
- **Data Encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3)**.
- **Logging for auditability**.
