# Scalability & Architecture Guide

## **1. Overview**
This guide outlines best practices for ensuring **scalability, reliability, and architectural efficiency** in the **Iterative Refinement Engine**. The goal is to support increasing workloads while maintaining performance and fault tolerance.

## **2. Objectives**
- Design a **scalable infrastructure** capable of handling high traffic.
- Optimize **distributed processing** for efficient resource utilization.
- Implement **horizontal and vertical scaling strategies**.
- Ensure **high availability and fault tolerance** for critical components.

## **3. Infrastructure Scalability Strategies**

### **3.1 Horizontal & Vertical Scaling**
- **Horizontal Scaling:**
- Distribute workloads across multiple computing instances.
- Use **Kubernetes (AKS) auto-scaling** for dynamic resource allocation.
- Implement **sharding techniques** for database scalability.
- **Vertical Scaling:**
- Optimize memory and CPU allocation based on workload intensity.
- Use **Azure VM Scale Sets** for automatic resource adjustments.
- Implement **containerized workloads** to enhance deployment flexibility.

### **3.2 Load Balancing & Traffic Management**
- Use **Azure Load Balancer** for distributing requests across instances, with session persistence and connection draining enabled for efficient traffic management.
- Implement **API Gateway (Azure API Management)** for centralized request routing.
- Apply **rate limiting and throttling** to prevent resource overutilization.

## **4. Distributed Processing & Resource Optimization**

### **4.1 Asynchronous Processing**
- Use **message queues (Azure Service Bus)** for inter-service communication, leveraging queue-based messaging for task distribution and topic-based messaging for event-driven workflows.
- Implement **event-driven architectures** to reduce processing delays.
- Optimize **task prioritization** for high-throughput performance by using predefined SLAs, urgency levels, and resource availability to ensure efficient execution.

### **4.2 Caching & Data Replication**
- Use **Azure Cache for Redis** to store frequently accessed data, applying least recently used (LRU) eviction strategy and setting appropriate expiration policies.
- Implement **read replicas** for database scalability.
- Cache AI model inferences to reduce redundant computations, setting expiration policies based on workload demands while ensuring model freshness through automatic invalidation.

## **5. High Availability & Fault Tolerance**

### **5.1 Redundancy & Failover Mechanisms**
- Deploy services across **multiple availability zones** for fault isolation, implementing cross-zone replication to maintain consistency and disaster recovery readiness.
- Use **geo-redundant storage** to ensure data availability.
- Implement **failover strategies** to reroute traffic during outages, including DNS-based failover and active-active replication to ensure continuous availability.

### **5.2 System Health Monitoring**
- Use **Azure Monitor** for real-time performance tracking, monitoring key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and system anomalies.
- Implement **automated self-healing mechanisms** to recover from failures.
- Apply **log aggregation and anomaly detection** for proactive issue resolution, leveraging machine learning-based pattern detection and rule-based alerts for real-time insights.
