# Security & Compliance Guide

## **1. Overview**
This guide outlines best practices for ensuring **security, privacy, and regulatory compliance** within the **Iterative Refinement Engine** and its associated AI services. Adhering to these principles helps mitigate security risks, protect user data, and maintain compliance with industry standards.

## **2. Objectives**
- Implement **data encryption** and secure storage practices.
- Enforce **access control policies** to safeguard sensitive information.
- Ensure compliance with **GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, CCPA, and other regulatory frameworks**.
- Monitor and respond to **security threats** proactively.

## **3. Data Security Measures**

### **3.1 Data Encryption & Secure Storage**
- Encrypt data **at rest** and **in transit** using **AES-256 and TLS 1.2+**, enforcing forward secrecy for TLS connections..
- Store sensitive information in **Azure Key Vault** or equivalent secure storage, ensuring access logs and audits for compliance tracking.
- Use **hashed and salted authentication credentials** (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to prevent credential theft.

### **3.2 Access Control & Authentication**
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit permissions.
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for administrative access.
- Use **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect** for secure API authentication, enforcing token expiration and refresh mechanisms to enhance security.

### **3.3 Secure Logging & Auditing**
- Store logs in a **tamper-proof, immutable format**.
- Retain logs for a **configurable period** to comply with audit requirements.
- Enable **real-time security event monitoring** using **Azure Sentinel**, including alerts for unauthorized access attempts, unusual data access patterns, and privilege escalation attempts..

## **4. Compliance & Regulatory Considerations**

### **4.1 GDPR & Data Privacy Compliance**
- Implement **data anonymization** where applicable.
- Allow users to **request data access, modification, or deletion**.
- Maintain **records of data processing activities** to ensure compliance.

### **4.2 HIPAA & Healthcare Data Protection**
- Ensure **PHI (Protected Health Information) encryption** at all stages.
- Maintain **audit trails** for healthcare-related data access.
- Implement **minimum necessary access** principles to limit exposure.

### **4.3 Industry & Internal Security Standards**
- Follow **ISO 27001** for information security management.
- Conduct **regular security assessments and penetration testing**.
- Enforce **vendor security compliance** for third-party integrations.

## **5. Threat Monitoring & Incident Response**

### **5.1 Proactive Security Monitoring**
- Implement **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** to monitor for threats.
- Use **machine learning models** to detect anomalous behavior.
- Continuously scan for **vulnerabilities and misconfigurations** using industry-standard tools such as OWASP ZAP and Nessus..

### **5.2 Incident Response & Mitigation**
- Maintain a **formalized incident response plan** including defined roles, escalation procedures, and regulatory reporting requirements..
- Automate **security patching** to mitigate known vulnerabilities, applying patches in a staged environment before deployment to production.
- Conduct **post-incident reviews** to prevent recurrence.
